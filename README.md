### Description
---
Chess is an abstract strategy game that involves no hidden information and no elements of chance. 
It is played on a chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid.
At the start, each player controls sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns.
White moves first, followed by Black.
The game is won by checkmating the opponent's king, i.e. threatening it with inescapable capture. There are also several ways a game can end in a draw.

There is an implementation of this game. You can play with your friend, record the results of your games.
The Model-View-Controller pattern was used.
I implemented: menu (where you can start new game, undo move, restart game, pause and quite), score board, chess board.
### Game control
